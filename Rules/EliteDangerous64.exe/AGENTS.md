# Elite Dangerous Agent Rule

Use this Rule only when a fresh WindowsAgent capture reports:

- `foreground.executable_name: EliteDangerous64.exe`
- `rule.status: matched`
- `rule.id: EliteDangerous64.exe`

## Current capability boundary

Read the exact `rule.actions.url` and `rule.registrations.url` from the capture
before using a game-specific capability.

`elite-dangerous/compass` is a finite, directly callable Action. It owns a
fixed compass region in the 1920x1080 reference coordinate space and its HUD
color interpretation. The game-neutral Observer maps that region through a
centered 16:9 viewport and returns reference-density pixels. A changed
foreground process or invalid compass evidence fails explicitly.

The Action declares that it may be registered as either a Monitor or Reaction,
but the registration catalog is intentionally empty. Do not infer a timer or
event subscription from `registrableAs`; declaring eligibility does not
activate a registration.
